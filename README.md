## 📖 About
A real-time sorting game. Common substances — from lemon juice to bleach — fall from the top of the screen, each showing its name and approximate pH. Three bins sit at the bottom: **Acid**, **Neutral**, and **Base**. Switch your active bin and click each substance to sort it correctly before it reaches the bottom.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Switch the **active bin** using:
   - Arrow keys (← →)
   - A / D keys
   - Tapping a bin directly
2. Click a falling substance to sort it into the currently active bin.
3. Correct sorting = +10 points.
4. Incorrect sorting, or letting an item fall to the bottom unsorted, costs 1 life (❤️).
5. Sort as many substances as possible before the 60-second timer runs out!

## ✅ Features
- Start screen + instructions screen
- Score tracking
- 3 lives (❤️)
- Single continuous 60-second timer
